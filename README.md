# Wordle recreation

Project written for the Programming in Graphical Environment course at the MiNI WUT Faculty. The project aims at creating a functional implementation of the popular Worlde game, using C++ and the WinAPI framework. Players are challenged to guess a hidden word within a limited number of attempts, with feedback provided on the correctness of each guess.
